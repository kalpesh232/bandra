-------*--------
differance between list tuple and dictoanry
List:
Mutable: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents (add, remove, or modify elements) after they are created.
Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements, and you can access elements by their index.
Syntax: Enclosed in square brackets [].
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Tuple:
Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change their contents after they are created. Once a tuple is defined, it cannot be modified.
Ordered: Like lists, tuples also maintain the order of elements and allow access by index.
Syntax: Enclosed in parentheses ().
Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Dictionary:
Mutable: Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to add, modify, or delete key-value pairs.
Unordered: Dictionaries do not maintain the order of key-value pairs. You access values by their associated keys.
Syntax: Enclosed in curly braces {} or created using dict(). Key-value pairs are separated by colons, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
Example: my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
